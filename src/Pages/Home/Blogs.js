                                making it imperative for developers to create apps with optimized performance. In React
                                applications, we are guaranteed a very fast UI by default. However, as an application
                                grows, developers may encounter some performance issues. Here are five important ways to
                                optimize the performance of a React application.

                                reach for to manage local state in react components. useReducer is another option that
                                can be used for either local or global state management.

                                <span className="font-semibold">Global state:</span> To manage it, we can use built-in

                                properties contains an internal and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The
                                Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in
                                objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of
                                another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object,
                                we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it
                                is being set using __proto__.
